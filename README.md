Description: For this project i decided to create a Sealtbelt controller that detects and alarms if ceratin safety fucntions are not done.
if the ignition of the car is on and the seatbelt isn't buckled,an LED light would blink for 5 seconds,if within the 5 second the seatbelt is buckled then the led would turn off,if within the 5 seconds the seatbelt isn't buckled then the led would stay on until it is buckled.if anytime when the ignition is on and the seat-belt is not buckled the led would stay on until it is buckled
